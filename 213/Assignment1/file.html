    Goodbye world!
    <a>The requirement for this exercise is to write JavaScript code to extract the text from an external HTML page and
        count the number of occurrences of each word in the text. The results should be presented in a table displaying
        each word and its number of occurrences. To gain more than 25 of the 35 available marks the output should be
        sorted, with the user being given the option of whether they should be displayed in alphabetical order or in
        order of number of occurrences. </a>
